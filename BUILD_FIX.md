# ðŸ”§ Build Fix Applied

## Issue
Next.js was trying to compile the `frontend/` folder which uses React Router (incompatible with Next.js).

## Solution
Created `.vercelignore` to exclude:
- `frontend/` - Separate React app
- `backend/` - Python FastAPI app
- Other non-Next.js files

Updated `tsconfig.json` to only include `src/` directory.

## Deploy Now

```bash
vercel --prod
```

The build should now succeed! âœ…
